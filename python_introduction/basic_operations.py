#Perfoming basic mathematical operations
#Using two predefined numbers, thus 10 and 5 for this exercise

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

#perform operations, thus, formulae
addition = number1 + number2
subtraction = number1 - number2
multiplication = number1 * number2

# Print results in the required human-readable format
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {addition}")
