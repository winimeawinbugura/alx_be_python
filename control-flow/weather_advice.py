# A simple program that recommends clothing based on weather conditions.

# Prompt the user for the current weather
weather = input("What's the weather like today? (sunny/rainy/cold): ").lower()

# Provide clothing recommendations using conditional statements
if weather == "sunny":
    print("Wear a t-shirt and sunglasses.")
elif weather == "rainy":

elif weather == "cold":
    print("Make sure to wear a warm coat and a scarf.")
else:
    print("Sorry, I don't have recommendations for this weather.")
